# react-native-ui-kitten
A [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) framework helps you to bootstrap your mobile app development. The main idea of this framework is to move style definitions into specific place making components reusable and styled in a single way. This should allow you to focus on business logic, rather than visual appearance.

This framework was made with :heart: by [Akveo team](http://akveo.com/).
